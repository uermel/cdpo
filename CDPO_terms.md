| CDPO:0000011 | support film fragment | Any detached part of the sample support film. |
| CDPO:0000012 | vacuum region | The empty space surrounding the specimen in the tomogram, representing areas with no material. |
| CDPO:0000013 | contamination | Unwanted material deposited on or near the specimen that is not part of the biological sample. |
| CDPO:0000014 | ice particle contamination | Crystalline or amorphous ice particles deposited on the specimen from atmospheric moisture. |
| CDPO:0000015 | sputter particle contamination | Metal or other particles deposited from sputtering during FIB milling or coating processes. |
| CDPO:0000016 | leopard skin contamination | A pattern of contamination or damage characterized by irregular spots on the specimen surface, typically from beam damage or devitrification. |
| CDPO:0000017 | sample artifact region | Any unintended alteration or feature in the specimen caused by sample preparation or imaging. |
| CDPO:0000018 | non-vitreous region | An area of the specimen where the ice has crystallized rather than remaining in a vitrified (amorphous) state. |
| CDPO:0000019 | dose-damaged region | An area of the specimen that has been altered due to excessive electron dose exposure. |
| CDPO:0000020 | protein aggregate | Aggregated or denatured protein material that is not representative of native biological structures. |
| CDPO:0000021 | curtaining artifact region | Vertical striping pattern in FIB-milled lamellae caused by differential milling rates. |
| CDPO:0000022 | sample tear | Physical discontinuity in the specimen caused by mechanical stress during handling or imaging. |
| CDPO:0000023 | fiducial marker | A reference marker used for alignment during tomographic reconstruction. |
| CDPO:0000024 | gold fiducial nanoparticle | Gold nanoparticles added to the specimen surface to serve as alignment markers for tomographic reconstruction. |
| CDPO:0000025 | gold CLEM label | Gold particles used as correlative light and electron microscopy markers to identify specific locations. |
| CDPO:0000026 | tomographic image artifact | A feature in a tomographic image that arises from data acquisition or processing rather than the specimen itself. |
| CDPO:0000027 | tomographic reconstruction artifact | A feature in the reconstructed tomogram that arises from the reconstruction process rather than the specimen. |
| CDPO:0000028 | unreconstructed region | An area of the tomogram that could not be properly reconstructed, typically due to missing wedge effects. |
| CDPO:0000029 | streak artifact | Linear artifacts radiating from high-contrast features, caused by limited tilt range or alignment errors. |
| CDPO:0000030 | sample charging artifact | Image distortion caused by electrostatic charge accumulation on the specimen. |
| CDPO:0000031 | laser phase plate off-plane artifact | Image artifact resulting from misalignment of the laser phase plate out of the focal plane. |
| CDPO:0000032 | laser phase plate off-node artifact | Image artifact resulting from the laser phase plate being positioned away from the optimal node position. |
| CDPO:0000033 | tomogram edge | The boundary of the reconstructed tomogram volume. |
